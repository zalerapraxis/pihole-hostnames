'''
Pihole is great, but the admin interface only displays device details 
by IP address which can be confusing. This script changes the display
from IP address to a more recognizable name, declared in an address list. 
We do this instead of grabbing the device's hostname as we can't change some
devices' hostnames.
Usage notes
- sudo python3 discovery.py
- Displays log messages at appropriate times
- when running as a service, remember to add 'Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1' under '[Service]'
